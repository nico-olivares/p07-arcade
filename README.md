HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project.
This project is a multi page project.
It has an entry point with a choice of two games.
One game is Mancala. This game has two options, single user against the machine and multi-player against a partner sharing the same computer (taking turns).
The single game is tough to beat. There's a link to a pdf with the game instructions (by Endless Games).
The Mancala page has background music that will play on some browsers without interaction while on some others it may require authorization.

The other game is Minesweeper. This game is pretty much up to spect with the original game. There are three levels to select from. 
The levels determine the grid size and number of bombs.
